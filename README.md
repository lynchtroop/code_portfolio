This is a portfolio of work that I have done whilst at SNT media. Files in the TCX folder contain work on a project that was 
tabled near it's completion. Some data was flowing through the backend and other data points where populated with dummy data. 
This was all done within the Angular Universal framework and is comprised of coding languages such as Typescript, HTML, and .LESS.
