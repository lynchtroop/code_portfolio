This is a portfolio of work that I have done whilst at SNT media. Files in the TCX folder contain work on a project that helped create unique article pages about college and professional football games using current and live data feeds; some of which were altered by our AI code base. All data came through api calls to the backend and where in a JSON format. This was all done within the Angular 2 framework and is comprised of coding languages such as Typescript, HTML, and .LESS.
