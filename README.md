This is a portfolio of work that I have done whilst at SNT media. Files in the TCX folder contain work on a project that helped 
create unique article pages about college and professional football games using current and live data feeds; some of which were 
altered by our AI code base. All data came through api calls to the backend and were in a JSON format. This was all done within 
the Angular 2 framework and is comprised of coding languages such as Typescript, HTML, and .LESS. This code was forked from a former
fellow employee at SNT Media for portfolio purposes only.
